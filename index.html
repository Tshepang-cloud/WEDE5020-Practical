    <h1>Website Proposal for “Golden Crumbs” – Biscuits & Sweets</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Golden Crumbs is a locally owned business specializing in artisanal biscuits and traditional sweets. With a growing customer base and increasing interest in online shopping, the business aims to develop a website that reflects its brand identity, showcases its products, and provides a seamless experience for customers.</p>

    <h2>2. Significance of the Project</h2>
    <p>Creating a website for Golden Crumbs is a strategic move that will:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enhance brand visibility in the local and regional market</li>
        <li>Enable online ordering and delivery services</li>
        <li>Provide mobile-friendly access to menus, promotions, and updates</li>
        <li>Facilitate direct communication with customers</li>
        <li>Showcase the craftsmanship and quality of products through visuals</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A website will serve as a digital storefront, helping Golden Crumbs compete effectively and grow sustainably.</p>

    <h2>3. Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Currently, Golden Crumbs operates solely through its physical store and social media. This presents several challenges:</p>

        <li>Difficulty managing customer inquiries and bulk orders</li>
        <li>Missed opportunities for marketing and customer retention</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Without a website, the business risks losing potential customers who prefer the convenience of online browsing and shopping.</p>

    <h2>4. Target Audience</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Local families and sweet lovers</li>
        <li>Tourists seeking authentic South African treats</li>
        <li>Corporate clients looking for branded gift boxes</li>
        <li>Event planners needing custom baked goods</li>
        <li>Health-conscious consumers (e.g., sugar-free, gluten-free options)</li>
    </ul>
